# ScholCite
CS530 - ScholCite Project in Java Swing
synopsis : This project is a simplistic version of Google Scholar using MVC architecture. Can be used to teach students about MVC patterns and UI design through a simple code and database integration. Not as complete as Google Scholar but aims to collate the missing pieces (z-index etc) in a single page view.
